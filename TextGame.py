Task: Create an Adventure Game.
I am going to create a game using Python 3 thats going to be using a
text based game thats based off an ordinary day of a highschool teenager.
There will be a series of A and B questions that result in different outcomes
in the end. This will show an underdstanding in Object Orientated Code and how
to apply it.
